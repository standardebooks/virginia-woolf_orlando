			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface</h2>
			<p>Many friends have helped me in writing this book. Some are dead and so illustrious that I scarcely dare name them, yet no one can read or write without being perpetually in the debt of Defoe, Sir Thomas Browne, Sterne, Sir Walter Scott, Lord Macauley, Emily Brontë, De Quincey, and Walter Pater⁠—to name the first that come to mind. Others are alive, and though perhaps as illustrious in their own way, are less formidable for that very reason. I am specially indebted to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C. P.</abbr> Sanger, without whose knowledge of the law of real property this book could never have been written. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sydney Turner’s wide and peculiar erudition has saved me, I hope, some lamentable blunders. I have had the advantage⁠—how great I alone can estimate⁠—of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Arthur Waley’s knowledge of Chinese. Madame Lopokova (<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. M.</abbr> Keynes) has been at hand to correct my Russian. To the unrivalled sympathy and imagination of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Roger Fry I owe whatever understanding of the art of painting I may possess. I have, I hope, profited in another department by the singularly penetrating, if severe, criticism of my nephew <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Julian Bell. Miss <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M. K.</abbr> Snowdon’s indefatigable researches in the archives of Harrogate and Cheltenham were none the less arduous for being vain. Other friends have helped me in ways too various to specify. I must content myself with naming <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Angus Davidson; <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cartwright; Miss Janet Case; Lord Berners (whose knowledge of Elizabethan music has proved invaluable); <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Francis Birrell; my brother, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Adrian Stephen; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F. L.</abbr> Lucas; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Desmond MacCarthy; that most inspiring of critics, my brother-in-law, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Clive Bell; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G. H.</abbr> Rylands; Lady Colefax; Miss Nellie Boxall; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. M.</abbr> Keynes; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hugh Walpole; Miss Violet Dickinson; the <abbr>Hon.</abbr> Edward Sackville-West; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr>St.</abbr> John Hutchinson; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Duncan Grant; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Stephen Tomlin; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and Lady Ottoline Morrell; my mother-in-law, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Sidney Woolf; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Osbert Sitwell; Madame Jacques Raverat; Colonel Cory Bell; Miss Valerie Taylor; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. T.</abbr> Sheppard; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T. S.</abbr> Eliot; Miss Ethel Sands; Miss Nan Hudson; my nephew <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Quentin Bell (an old and valued collaborator in fiction); <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Raymond Mortimer; Lady Gerald Wellesley; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lytton Strachey; the Viscountess Cecil; Miss Hope Mirrlees; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">E. M.</abbr> Forster; the <abbr>Hon.</abbr> Harold Nicolson; and my sister, Vanessa Bell⁠—but the list threatens to grow too long and is already far too distinguished. For while it rouses in me memories of the pleasantest kind it will inevitably wake expectations on the reader which the book itself can only disappoint. Therefore I will conclude by thanking the officials of the British Museum and Record Office for their wonted courtesy; my niece Miss Angelica Bell, for a service which none but she could have rendered; and my husband for the patience with which he has invariably helped my researches and for the profound historical knowledge to which these pages owe whatever degree of accuracy they may attain. Finally, I would thank, had I not lost his name and address, a gentleman in America, who has generously and gratuitously corrected the punctuation, the botany, the entomology, the geography, and the chronology of previous works of mine and will, I hope, not spare his services on the present occasion.</p>
